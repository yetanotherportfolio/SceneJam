# SceneJam

Simple, engine agnostic, 2d scene editor.

Support:
 - placing elements in a 2d scene
 - configure sprite animations
 - configure tweens
 - setup game width/height
 - setup scenes background color

An example using the [Phaser Loader](https://github.com/yetanotherportfolio/SceneJamPhaserLib) can be found [here](https://github.com/yetanotherportfolio/SceneJamPhaserExample).

## RUN
using [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/)

$ nw .

## DEBUG in a web browser

$ npm run debug

## BUILD

$ npm run dist

## TODO

- Cookie cutter project starter
- Better asset container handling
- Documentation
- Video demo
- Rework changing working dir and import/export UX

## Note

The project is **very WIP**, but still kinda usable.

My goal is to make something that would help me/other save times during gamejams.
